<h1>Could Dogecin Become a Universal Game Currency?</h1>

<p>If we help make it happen, I believe the answer is yes! (see latest updates <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/2hrqv2/updates_million_dogecoin_game_dev_contest/">here</a>.)</a></p>

<h3>The Game Contest</h3>

<p>In the past, the Dogecoin community had a competition to build an Electrum-based wallet <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/dogecoin/comments/1upa5y/bounty_15_million_doge_for_the_first_person_to/" class="imgScanned">here</a>, and we had some great results. Let's do it again, but this time around, build an awesome game! The only rule is it must incorporate Dogecoin in some way. The community will vote on the winners of each category. The ultimate goal of this competition is to explore innovative uses for the Dogecoin currency.</p>

<h3>The Rules!</h3>

<p>You must start a new project or integrate Dogecoin into an existing game. Existing games may win any category except the "most popular/viral" category which will go to a new game built in Oct 2014. The game may be a web app, or native platform app (iOS, Windows, Android..). All apps must be "secure" against theft of private data or dogecoins.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>See this Dogecoin space game faucet <a href="http://dt.htdt.ru/" class="imgScanned">http://dt.htdt.ru/</a><span title="press 2 to open link" class="keyNavAnnotation">[2] </span> , it's even open source! <a href="https://github.com/htdt/digital_trip" class="imgScanned">https://github.com/htdt/digital_trip</a><span title="press 3 to open link" class="keyNavAnnotation">[3] </span></p>

<h3>Prize Categories!</h3>

<p>The categories are especially designed to encourage games to be made. The following percentages of the pot will be assigned for each category in order of placement. (ie, first place in "most original" will get 10% of the pot)</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Most popular/ viral. Must be a new game started during this contest timeframe, not a sequel. - 30% to winner, 10% to runner up.</p></li>
<li><p>Best game that incorporates Dogecoin as an in-game currency with in-game purchases. - 20% to winner.</p></li>
<li><p>Best game the integrates DogeParty somehow - 20% to winner</p></li>
<li><p>Most App Store downloads (web based games not eligible for this) - 10% awarded one month after contest completion.</p></li>
<li><p>Silliest / most ridiculous game - 10% to winner</p></li>
</ul>

<h3>The Due Date!</h3>

<p>End of the day (PST) on October 31, 2014.</p>

<h3>Prize Pot and Sponsors</h3>

<p>A pot will be added to during competition. I'll start the pot with 1 million dogecoins ( <a href="http://www.reddit.com/u/echo85" class="userTagged imgScanned">/u/echo85</a><span class="RESUserTag"><a class="userTagLink RESUserTagImage" username="echo85" title="set a tag" href="javascript:void(0)"></a></span> <a href="javascript:void(0)" class="voteWeight" style="display: none;">[vw]</a><span title="press 4 to open link" class="keyNavAnnotation">[4] </span> ). Unless / until a better option volunteers itself, I'll be storing the pot in a dedicated wallet. Why should you trust me? Well, I've tipped about 4 million Doge on reddit and twitter, much at higher prices than we have now! Also, you know who I am, and I'll name my Canadian company "countable.ca" as the account holder. It's a small company but it's been around quite a while. At the end of the day, if you don't trust me to watch the account, DON'T donate! If you make a large contribution, you'll be mentioned in all communication here on as a sponsor. For my contribution, my little digital shop project, DogeLet.com will be named as a sponsor.</p>

<h3>Guide for Developers</h3>

<p>
I suggest using <a href="https://block.io">block.io</a> in order to integrate Dogecoin easily without running your own copy of dogecoind. If you're awarding Dogecoin to users for any type of in-game action, you'll need a way to verify they're not cheating. One straightforward way is with a server component such as <a href="socket.io">socket.io</a> in the example above. If anyone has more examples or resources for developers, please post them for everyone to benefit from!
<a href="https://github.com/countable/games4doge-contest">Here's some example code</a> which deposit Dogecoin and spends it in-game.
For an even simpler way to integrate Dogecoin, make your game a "faucet" that simply rewards your users when they get a high score by sending Dogecoin to their address.
